# personal-site

### Description

Welcome to my project! This is a personal portfolio made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is broken down into three pages: home, about, and portfolio.

- The homepage includes my mission statement, as well as one of my favorite quotes.
- The about page is where you can get to know me. I've listed a few things that I enjoy doing and really tell who I am.
- The portfolio page is where you can find my previous projects. Because I don't have any to showcase at the moment, I currently have placeholders to show where they would be.

        Football is my favorite sport. During the NFL season I spend pretty much
        every Sunday tuning into all of the games. My favorite team is the
        Philadelphia Eagles (Go Birds!) and while they didn't win it all, it was
        still awesome to see them go that far! I also love playing fantasy
        football with my friends and spend way too much time prepping and
        researching (and blowing money please don't tell my girlfriend) on it.

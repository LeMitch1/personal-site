            Football is my favorite sport. During the NFL season I spend pretty
            much every Sunday tuning into all of the games. My favorite team is
            the Philadelphia Eagles (Go Birds!) and while they didn't win it
            all, it was still awesome to see them go that far!
          </p>

            I also love playing fantasy football with my friends and spend way
            too much time prepping and researching (and blowing money please
            don't tell my fiance) on it.

            I have always enjoyed playing video games. Growing up we had all
            sorts of consoles from the Nintendo 64 to the original Xbox.
            Currently I have the Playstation 5 and it is just amazing to see how
            far games and technology have come.

            The PSVR2 was recently released and words can't describe how it
            makes you feel when you put that headset on. Everything is so
            immersive and it really puts you into the game!

            Piggybacking off the topic above, my fiance and I like to spend some
            evenings just being cozy and playing games. We are currently going
            through Minecraft Dungeons which is actually pretty fun!
          </p>
          <p>
            We also like to go out and find new places to eat. We recently got
            some mochi donuts which were so delicious! It's easy to find things
            to do with her cause we have very similar interests. I think she's
            the one.
